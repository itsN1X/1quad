A reusable `.gnummeric is held at the master's root off this repository.

### Suppose:
 - That`C4` is the 'daily cost price';
 - That`C3` is the 'weekly cost price';
 - That`C2` is the 'monthly cost price';
 - That`C1` is the 'index cost price';
 - That`C0` is the 'level cost price';
 
 Additionally, `C0` may need to be `#def` defined as an `uint`, preferably (iff possible) indexing commencing at `1` instead of a `False`.
 
## Usage
Clone, login  then fork your own.
  Virtuals: `endl`
